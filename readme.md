Android Contacts
================

I wrote this Android app to complete a test when applying to a job offered to me some time ago.

**Features**

- Lists contacts from the address book or a local database via drop-down menu
- For each contact shows his/her name, photo and the number of emails addresses and phone numbers
- Tapping on a contact shows buttons for viewing data or saving data locally (inside of the contact's row in the listview)
- Taping on the contact's thumbnail shows the full size image
- Tapping on "View" shows the contact's phone numbers and email adresses
- Tapping on "Save" saves the contact's data on a local database
- Tapping on a phone number calls a web service to bring data about that number
